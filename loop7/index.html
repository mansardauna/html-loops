        though most peoole don't take the time to find someone<br> who truly respect them. Its seems like people are just<br> looking for someone to show them slightest amount of<br>attention, setting for something much less than respect. I <br>
      am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship<br> grow is by showing respect.
  <p>I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be<br> respected. What is respect? Respect is showing  someone <br>extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to<br> show them how highly they are valued. </p></span>
